Part 1: Array Basics

1. Create an Array
Create an array named numbers containing the numbers: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.

Print the array to the console.

Print the first and last elements of the array.



2. Modify an Array

Add the number 60 to the end of the numbers array.

Remove the first element from the array.

Print the modified array.



3. Iterate Through an Array
Write a function printArray that takes an array as input and logs each element
to the console.

Part 2: Functions with Arrays

4. Find the Maximum Number
Write a function findMax that takes an array of numbers as input and returns
the largest number.
Example:

findMax([10, 50, 40, 30, 20]); // Output: 50

5. Sum All Numbers
Write a function sumArray that takes an array of numbers as input and returns
the sum of all the numbers in the array.
Example:

sumArray([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]); // Output: 150


6. Filter Even Numbers
Write a function filterEven that takes an array of numbers and returns
an array containing only the even numbers.
Example:

filterEven([10, 15, 20, 25, 30]); // Output: [10, 20, 30]

Part 3: Advanced Array Operations

7. Count Numbers Greater than 25
Write a function countGreaterThan25 that uses the filter method to return how many numbers in the array are greater than 25.
Example:

countGreaterThan25([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]); // Output: 3

Part 4: Challenge Tasks

8. Remove Duplicates
Write a function removeDuplicates that takes an array as input and returns
a new array with duplicate values removed.
Example:

removeDuplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
