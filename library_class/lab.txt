You will create a simple library management system that allows users to:

1- Add books to the library.
2- Borrow books from the library.
3- Return books to the library.
4- List available books.

The system will consist of two modules:

Book.js - Contains the definition of the Book class.

Library.js - Contains the definition of the Library class and implements the core functionality.

Finally, you'll use an entry point file, app.js, to bring everything together.



1. Create the Book.js Module

Define a Book class in this module with the following:

a- Properties:
title (string)
author (string)
isAvailable (boolean, default is true)

b- Methods:
borrow() - Sets isAvailable to false.
returnBook() - Sets isAvailable to true.
Export the Book class from the module.

2. Create the Library.js Module

Define a Library class in this module with the following:

a- Properties:
name (string)
books (array to store Book objects)

b- Methods:
addBook(book) - Adds a Book object to the books array.
listAvailableBooks() - Logs the titles and authors of all available books.
borrowBook(title) - Finds the book by title and marks it as borrowed if available; otherwise, logs that the book is not available.
returnBook(title) - Finds the book by title and marks it as returned if it's currently borrowed; otherwise, logs that the book is not borrowed.
Export the Library class from the module.


3. Create the Entry Point app.js
Import the Book and Library classes.
Create a library object, e.g., const myLibrary = new Library('City Library');
Add some books to the library using the addBook method.

Test the functionality:
a- List all available books.
b- Borrow a book.
c- Attempt to borrow a book that is already borrowed.
d- Return a book.
e- Attempt to return a book that wasn't borrowed.
